# Understanding-Income-Inequality---Using-KNN

For this project, we are given the census data (adult-all dataset) with attributes of US citizens such as occupation, education, gender, race, etc. To assist organizations on working to ensure equal pay, we are planning to build a model that would achieve the goal of accurately classify low income from high income citizens. Meanwhile, this model should also provide us insights about attributes contribute to affluency and how can we improve policies in the US.

There are two parts needed to be complete in this project:

#Part 1:
Use proper data cleansing techniques to ensure that you have the highest quality data to model this problem. Detail your process and discuss the decisions you made to clean the data.

#Part 2:
Build a nearest neighbors model with the given data, interpret the results, and convey those results to stakeholders. Highlight key learning points such as feature importance of variables, how those variables explain the scenario, how you determined K, why you choose that final value of K, and the overall accuracy of your model and accompanying models.

#Both of these two parts will be completed using Python on Jupyter Notebook. Necessary codes and visuals will be attached directly within this report, and the full python script will be submitted separately in another file.
